      <description>I am currently a PHD student in Shanghai University of Finance and Economics(SUFE), advised by Dr. Xingdong Feng. Previously, I received my B.S. in Mathematics from Shanghai University of Finance and Economics(SUFE), in June 2019.
I am strongly interested in Reinforcement Learning(RL) and its applications. I currently focus on the multi-agent problem in RL.</description>
