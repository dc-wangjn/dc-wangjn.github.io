I am currently a PHD student in [Shanghai University of Finance and Economics](https://english.sufe.edu.cn/)(SUFE), advised by Dr. [Xingdong Feng](https://bb9.sufe.edu.cn/bbcswebdav/users/2011000070/index.htm).  Previously, I received my B.S. in Mathematics from Shanghai University of Finance and Economics(SUFE),  in June 2019.

I am strongly interested in Reinforcement Learning(RL) and its applications. I currently focus on the multi-agent problem in RL.
